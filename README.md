This repository holds the practise quetions and the logic to solve them

Some important observations :

1. The difference between length and length() methods 

  - > length is used to find the size of the array 
      Eg : a[50] , int size = a.length;
  
  - > length() is used to find the size of the String or the String Builder Class
      Eg : a , int size = a.length();
      
 
2. Difference bw read() and readLine() for  string input 

  - > The read() method is used to read an input with space as a delimiter
  - > The readLine() method is used to read an input with enter as the delimiter where enter is \n
  
  The main issue was that readLine does not wait for the user input and completes the execution of the code .
